# OceanEyes
OceanEyes leverages recent advances in computer vision to detect and identify marine species from underwater images and videos. This project aims to enhance marine research and conservation efforts by expediting the generation of baseline datasets on remote benthic ecosystems.

# Features

- [ ] Seabed substrate classification
    - [ ] Unsupervised
    - [ ] Supervised
- [ ] Feature space projection of the seafloor
- [ ] Real-time processing of live video feeds for taxa identification.
- [ ] Tensorboard visualizations of performance evaluation metrics.
- [ ] Summarizing (taxa and habitat) detections into ready-to-use csv files for downstream spatio-ecological analysis.
